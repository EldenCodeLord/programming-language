        <h2>Trying to decide which programming language to start with?</h2>
        <p class="unimportant">Learning coding languages can be very overwhelming and stressful.
          There are so many languages to choose from. It helps to start off with 
          the basics. By no means does "basic" mean easy. Every programming language
          has it's strengths and complexities. 
        </p>
        <p class="important">Here is a list of programming languages!:</p>
        <ul class="list"> <div class="column">
           <li>Ruby</li>
           <li>C#</li>
           <li><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong></li>
           <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
           <li>Python</li>
           <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
           <li>Swift</li>
            </div>
        </ul>
        <p>Noticed how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is in bold letters? That's because I 
          believe that these are good programming languages to begin with. They will teach
          you basic terminology and syntax structures.
